### Automation
- The `Build CV` workflow renders both `cv.pdf` and an HTML version with the shared minimalist theme.
- The PDF export is published as a workflow artifact named `cv` on every run.
- The generated HTML is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages, available at `https://<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/` once Pages is enabled for the repository.
